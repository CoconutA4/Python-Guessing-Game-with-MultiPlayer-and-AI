    <h2><u><b> ‚ô•Ô∏è Features </u></b> </h2>
    &bull; Different Difficulties <br>
    &bull; Computer Multiplayer <br>
    &bull; Single-player <br>
    &bull; Multiplayer <br>
    &bull; Easy to expand upon <br>
    &bull; It includes a lot of comments explaining the code <br>
 </p>
 
 <p>
   <h2><u><b> ‚ô•Ô∏è How to play? / (How it works) </b></u></h3> 
   &bull; As soon as you start, the console will ask your name (and store it in the var myName) <br>
   &bull; When the console knows your name it will ask if you want to play the tutorial (if you say yes it initiates the tut function, else it just moves on to var modeselector)<br>
   &bull; After selecting your game mode, the program starts the specific function (sp, ai or mp) <br>
   &bull; On all the game modes, you will have to choose a difficulty (var level) <br>
   &bull; If you chose sp - You have to find a number that is randomly generated by the computer <br>
   &bull; If you chose ai - You have to find a number before ai those <br>
   &bull; If you chose mp - You have to find a number before your friend <br>
   &bull; After each game, you will be asked if you want to restart (restart_.. functions) or quit <br>

  </p>

   <h2><u><b> ‚ô•Ô∏è Coding style </b></u></h3> 
   &bull; There are 2 types of comments (I - Important) and (NI - Not important)) <br>
   &bull; There's 1 line gap between everything, besides if's <br>
   &bull; I like to make a lot of functions, therefor if u want to expand the code is quite easy <br>
  

   <h2><u><b> ‚ô•Ô∏è Explaining the functions </b></u></h3> 
   &bull; bug - used for crash/error handling <br>
   &bull; troll - used for when the player doesn't cooperate with the game <br>
   &bull; sg - function that contains the game / game functions <br>
   &bull; restart_sp - restarts single-player <br>
   &bull; restart_ai - restarts ai <br>
   &bull; restart_mp - restarts multiplayer <br>
   &bull; tut - starts the tutorial <br>
   &bull; sp - starts single-player <br>
   &bull; ai - starts ai <br>
   &bull; mp - starts multiplayer <br>

   <h2><u><b> ‚ô•Ô∏è Explaining the important variables (var) </b></u></h3> 
   &bull; myName - used all around the code, it contains the 1st player name <br>
   &bull; modeselector - used to select the game mode player wants to play <br>
   &bull; level - used to select the difficulty <br>
   &bull; top - max upper range of random number generated <br>
